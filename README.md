# Shavzak
As a Computer Science student and an active combat officer in the Israeli reserves during an extended period of war, I felt a strong need to combine my professional knowledge with the operational challenges I encountered during my military service. This led me to create a program called Shavzak, designed to assist commanders in building fair and organized mission schedules for their soldiers.

The application is built with Windows Forms in C#. It allows a commander to manage a list of soldiersâ€”adding new ones, removing them, viewing all soldiers, and searching for specific individuals. The goal is to create an intuitive interface that simplifies the task of distributing missions equally and effectively across the unit.
